# Sanskrit Transliterator

Forked from [this repository](https://github.com/sanskrit/sanscript) to create a tool for transliterating Sanskrit.

Inspired by [this tool](https://www.learnsanskrit.org/tools/sanscript/) from learnsanskrit.org. Made some quality of life adjustments to fit my specific needs.
